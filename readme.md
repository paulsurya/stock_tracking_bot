## Welcome to my First Python project

---

### About :chart:Trackify:chart: :-

Its a small Telegram bot that can do the following things;
1.Create a <u>_watchlist_</u> for the user
2.Create a <u>_portfolio_</u> of the users exchanges
3.Analysing stock to predict whether to <u>_BUY_</u> or <u>_SELL_</u>

</ul>

### The Basics :-

These are the basic concepts that I used;

**_Watchlist_**(:eyes:)

> _Takes a ticker of a particular stock and adds it the users personalized watchlist and after 24 hrs it would update on the changes of those stocks:dollar:_
>
> > This feartue is not fullf implemented yet

**_Portfolio_**(:scroll:)

> _This command takes all the <u>Buys and Sells</u> of the users and records their to total profit. This is useful to analyse the users gains_
>
> > This feartue is not fullf implemented yet and the idea might be changed
